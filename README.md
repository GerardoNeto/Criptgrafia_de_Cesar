Hello there, My name is Gerardo Neto, i'm a student of Computer Science(CS), this is my first commit for the course.
This project aims to develop a computer simulation of one of the first cryptographic systems in history: the Caesar Cipher.
The goal is to demonstrate the practical application of programming logic and data manipulation to solve the problem of information confidentiality.
